Analysis:

In modern banking systems, event processing is critical for handling 
millions of daily transactions including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and payments. 
This implementation simulates a real-world banking scenario processing 10,000,000 events 
using two distinct architectural patterns: PULL and PUSH event dispatching models. 
The PULL model implements a queue-based approach where consumers actively request events 
from a centralized event manager, enabling loose coupling and allowing consumers to process at their own pace. 
This pattern is beneficial in distributed banking systems where transaction processing services may have variable capacity. 
The PUSH model employs direct event delivery where the producer immediately notifies registered consumers, 
eliminating polling overhead and reducing latency. For high-volume banking operations, 
the PUSH model demonstrates superior performance due to its immediate event delivery mechanism and reduced 
CPU cycles spent on queue polling. However, the PULL model offers better scalability for scenarios 
with multiple consumers processing events at different rates, making it suitable 
for banking systems with heterogeneous processing services. 
Both models utilize bulk database operations (simulating PostgreSQL bulk inserts) 
to efficiently persist banking events, with batch processing significantly improving throughput 
compared to individual event inserts. The choice between models depends on specific banking 
requirements: PUSH for real-time transaction processing where low latency is critical, 
and PULL for batch processing systems where decoupling and flexible consumer scaling are priorities.
